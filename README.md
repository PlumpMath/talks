# Talks

A bunch of LaTeX sources for talks I've given. Feel free to reuse these sources for your own talks. Also, please consider sharing your LaTeX sources for your talks and papers as well. Note that I published LaTeX sources of my papers in this [repository](https://bitbucket.org/malb/publications).

There are also a few older [PDFs](https://bitbucket.org/malb/talks/downloads) of slides. Let me know if I should try to dig up their sources.
