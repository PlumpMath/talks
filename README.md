# Talks #

A bunch of LaTeX sources for my talks. Feel free to reuse these sources for your own talks. Also, please consider sharing your LaTeX sources for your talks and papers as well. 

I also [publish](https://bitbucket.org/malb/publications) LaTeX sources of my papers.

- There are also a few older [PDFs](https://bitbucket.org/malb/talks/downloads) of slides. Let me know if I should try to dig up their sources.
- For PDF versions see [pdf branch](https://bitbucket.org/malb/talks/src/pdf).
